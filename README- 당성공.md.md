# Problem Statement

## Business Goal

1. 더 빠른 투표 방식을 사용하고 싶다.
2. 더 낮은 원가

## The Problem

The traditional voting method is inconvenient, requires a lot of preparation work and is very inefficient, so I hope there is a simple and flexible voting method that can be deployed at any time and anywhere. Entered into the system by the user. Then, employees can vote for or against. A person can only cast one vote. Each vote is stored in the database of the corresponding parameters. At the end of the voting process, the system counts the total number of votes and informs the user.

## Scenarios

### User scenario

After the application is launched, the user will see a menu and press ‘start’ to start voting.

The user can enter ‘1’ to indicate approval or ‘2’ to indicate disapproval.

After all voting ends, the system will sort out the final voting results and show them to users.

### Admin scenario

Users save and display all data after voting.

## Requirements (User Stories)

### Basic System

## main page

FR1: There is a ‘start’ prompt.

## user

FR2: Display a paragraph "Please enter the number of candidates"

FR3: Can enter the number of candidates

FR4: Can enter the name of the candidate

FR5:Vote for the set candidates

FR6:Store all voting data

FR7:The result will be displayed after the voting is over

FR8:There is a ‘close’ prompt
